// MARK: - ASRProvider.swift

//
// Protocol placeholder for pluggable speech recognition back ends.
//
// Production builds would conform to this protocol to supply words
// and timestamps to `MicPipeline`.  It remains empty in this prototype
// because Parakeet is driven from Python instead of native Swift.
