// MARK: - AppleSpeechASRProvider.swift

//
// Stub for a potential native speech recogniser using Apple's Speech
// framework.  The class is intentionally omitted from this prototype
// to keep the binary small.  A real implementation would conform to
// `ASRProvider` and stream recognized words to `MicPipeline`.
